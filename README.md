# 05 Third-Party APIs: Scheduler (myscheduler)

## Make Your Own Schedule and Automatically Track It!

The purpose of this project was to create an application that generates a schedule that can track and save users input and change such schedule dynamically with color coded blocks for times of the day that are past, present, or future. In addition, the scheduler will save user input for the next time the user logs in.
